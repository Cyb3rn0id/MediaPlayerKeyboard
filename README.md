A simple USB Keyboard for controlling media players using the Arduino Leonardo.  
I've used 4 cheap arcade pushbuttons for PLAY/PAUSE - STOP - Previous Song - Next Song and a chinese Rotary Encoder for System Volume control, but, hey, here's the source code so you can personalize it!  
Please: if you realize this project, send me some pictures so I'll include them in my blog linking your website or whatever you want!
